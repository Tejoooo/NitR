# NitR
This is the first Hackathon I have participated in .It was woth a experience.
My team did built an application which helps one to contact the nearest doctors and solve there helath issues.



Technologies that I learnt during building this application:
1> I did get to know abt the website builders such as wix, It was fun using it.
2> I did learn Django framework for the backend part.
3> Developed skills to make websites to look more aesthetic and appealing.
4> Learnt how to handle the team as a Team leader n Mainly how to divide the work.
5> Learnt how dedicated ppl are towards the hackathons.


Though we did end up loosing but everything is for a good cause.
